Trying out github features 
Watching freeCodeCamp's video by Gwendolyn Faraday about Git for beginners.
I will emulate here every thing that she does in the video, and get some practice for version in the SGSN project.

# Demo
Turns out you can track changes with git. Also, it recognizes if you add any files,
like index.html for example. You then have to commit everything, or add the new files.
git add .  -> commits everything new and adds everything new. Nifty command.
